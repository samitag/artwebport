  <p>I was intrigued by Carrion's insistence on differentiating between books and text and the fact that books and poetry utilize space. I was a bit confused by what the author means when he says a novel is where nothing happens, yet there will always be people who enjoy them (the same as people enjoy other small life pleasures). I feel like I occasionally understand what he is saying in his comparisons, but I would argue that many of his statements have no elaboration and can be easily refuted. My only guess is that he purposefully means to be questioned at times.</p>

  <p>I am interested in the inclusion of the graphics throughout the reading. I noticed they were on theme of websites and could be considered ASCII Art too. The creative choice to give advice in cartoon text bubbles over photographs also puzzled me. Overall, I enjoyed how this reading compared a website to many other things, like a plant. It also got me thinking about how people  (including myself!) use online website makers like Squarespace and Wix but don’t really understand what is happening behind it.</p>

  <p>My favorite part of this reading was the section, "Print vs. electrons. 100 differences and similarities between paper and pixel". I found it to be a unique read with all of the different terminology for the same concepts present in print and digital media. Some of these were humorous, such as comparing the smell of ink to the sound of mouse clicks and paperback vs. hardback to free vs. paid access. Yet in both, dust was dust. One thing the reading brought to mind was instances when technology mimics print. For example, the paper background and or paper-textured screen protectors for kindles and iPads. Or, when the web is designed with dots to make the screen look printed or from a risograph.</p>

  <p>A line that stood out to me in particular while reading is the following: "The internet once referenced the signs of AFK (away from keyboard) life, but now AFK life references the web". I thought this was an interesting observation and I believe it to be true. I feel that there has been a dramatic shift in how much we talk about the web in "real life", which is understandable considering the role it plays in our day to day life today. However, I disagree with (or perhaps don't understand) the author's next point that this is a "degradation". If anything, I see this as a mutual relationship between the two.</p>

  <p>The section about Susan Kare in this reading made me realize how many deliberate decisions were made in making a graphical interface. Nowadays, there are so many behaviors we take for granted when we use computers. For example, colors changing when we hover, drop-downs, hamburger menu icons, etc. Even the fact that a window will pop up and give us a visual inside files or a disk. It's interesting to me how much we have become accustomed to an interface and rarely think about the fact that deliberate decisions had to be made to make them. </p>

<div class="content">
  <p>Before I read this workbook, I was curious what someone could have to say about alt-text to make entire workbook on it (knowing that this is the abridged version too). I didn't think I knew everything to know about alt-text, but I have written alt-text before in the past and I didn't think much of it except that it's something important that you should do. I was pleasantly surprised from this reading with how much there is to say about alt-text and I read many things I have never thought about before. For example, I always think of alt-text as very objective and to the point. I liked the idea that you could describe the image with a bit more feeling, or that you could use language that fits the tone of the rest of the site. The idea of using first person in alt-text was also very compelling to me. </p>

<div class="content">
  <p>I found this reading increasingly puzzling as I continued through it but I appreciated the sections on surface and value. I found the way the author examined the arbitrary value we assign to various objects to be compelling. "Design must be invested with the potential, the intelligence and the tools 
    to break down the new borders it has created by being borderless". I'm not sure I agree with the author- or perhaps I don't understand them on this point. I think "the borders" that are created are not really borders but rather features that require a designer to keep in mind good practices while designing. I don't really understand where they are seeing a new divide that hasn't already existed in the past.</p>

  <p>This has been my favorite reading thus far. As I learn to program in Java and OCaml in my other courses, I have posed the same question as the author but I had been reluctant to search for an answer. It seemed to be very complicated and open a can of worms. I wasn't surprised that the author couldn't come up with a conclusive answer, but I'm interested to research more about if there may be a way for programming languages written in different natural languages to build upon each other.</p>

  <p>About a third of the way through this reading I realized I have previously read "RADICAL PUBLISHING DURING CRISIS" by Paul Soulellis which touches on similar ideas as this one. The idea of resisting smoothness really resonates with me in his writing. As a designer (especially one who will be looking for a job soon) I feel tension between business wanting to make an experience increasingly "smooth" and the possibility that we are losing our individual autonomy and putting more and more power and trust in the hands of businesses and technology. Sometimes I don't know where the line is between embracing innovation and having skepticism for every new product/update.</p>

  <p>I really appreciated the connections the story made between computers and history and how it discussed the suppression of the truth about the treatment of marginalized groups in history. I also really enjoyed thinking about how this story connected to our reading from last week, in how technology can suppress the truth, is designed to control the user, and can remove an individual's autonomy.  Gem's experience in the Way, as well as her hope to overcome these issues in the Beyond, in many ways reflect our relationship with technology today. </p>

  <p>I enjoyed Chun's discussion about how software creates a layer between what is happening in the computer and the instructions actually being sent by the user. Often times, we don't even see our actions as instructions, such as when we type in a word processor. As I complete programming assignments for other classes I often find myself confused between what is "real" and what is not. What is actually happening when I type into an editor, preview on my work, or when my code goes through the homework autograder? I also feel like my group's PBJ project played with some of these ideas, where we wrote fake code that convincingly appeared to compile and run, when in reality it had no functionality. </p>
